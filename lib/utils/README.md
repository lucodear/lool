# Installation

This library is for internal use. And as such, it's only published privately. 

```bash
cargo add lool --registry=lugit --features utils {sub-feature}?
```

# Sub-Features

This library is divided into several sub-features, each one providing a different set of utilities. This allows you to only include the parts you need, reducing compile times.

- [x] [`utils.threads`](./threads): utilities for working with threads in Rust.
